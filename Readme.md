## Some more Instructions

```
POST localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
POST localhost:8080/actuator/bus-refresh

Run this project only in intellij

1. Install erlang and rabbit mq in your system
2. Download zipkin server jar and keep it in the same folder



3. While rabbitmq service is running in BG

set RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost                        
java -jar zipkin-server-2.12.9-exec.jar   (To launch Zipkin server)


NOTE:- If it's the 1st time you're setting up your project make sure to initialise  git-localconfig-repo as a git repo so that spring-cloud-config-server could pick up the changes, and change the gitrepo path in application.properties file of spring-cloud-config-server.
```
